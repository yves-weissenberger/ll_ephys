1. Test the duration for HD classification.
    1. Make sure its only for the inpoke
    2. Leave out more neighbours (in graph or in space)
2. Look at and make spike raster population for the generalisation rotation thing
3. Look at the order at which they grow outwards
4. Look at cells that dominate the correlation
5. Look at veronikas analysis or the CCA

6. Take out current location space. then look for now location space. That tells you about information from previous. 
Subtract space. Rotate graph by 1 correlate with space again. To see if 

7. rerun try_rotate_non_spatial_responses

8. rerun transition analysis switching graphs

9. transition anaylsis without space.
