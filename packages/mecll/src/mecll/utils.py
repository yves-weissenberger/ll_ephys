def align_activity(trial_times, target_times, spikes, fs=25, smooth_SD='default', plot=False):
    '''Calculate trial aligned smoothed firing rates. Spike times are first transformed from 
    the original time frame to a trial aligned time frame in which a set of reference time
    points for each trial are mapped onto a set of target time points (e.g. the median trial
    timings), with linear interpolation of spike times between the reference points.  
    Once the spike times have been transformed into the trial aligned reference frame the
    firing rate is calculated at a specified sampling rate, using Gaussian smoothing with 
    a specified standard deviation, taking into acount the change in spike density due to 
    the time warping.

    Arguments:
    trial_times : Array of reference point times for each trial (ms). Shape: [n_trials, n_ref_points]
    target_times: Reference point times to warp each trial onto (ms). Shape: [n_ref_points]
    spikes:  Array of neuron IDs and spike times. Shape [2, n_spikes]
             spikes[0,:] is neuron IDs, spikes [1,:] is spike times (ms).
    fs: Sampling rate of output firing rate vector (Hz).
    smooth_SD: Standard deviation of gaussian smoothing applied to ouput rate (ms). 
               If set to default, smooth_SD is set to the inter sample interval.
    plot: If set to True, plots the average trial aligned activity for first 5 neurons.

    Returns:
    aligned_rates: Array of trial aligned smoothed firing rates (Hz). 
                   Shape: [n_trials, n_neurons, n_timepoints]
    t_out: Times of each output firing rate time point (ms).
    min_max_stretch: Minimum and maximum stretch factor for each trial.  Used to exclude 
                     trials which have extreme deviation from target timings.
                     Shape: [n_trials, 2]
