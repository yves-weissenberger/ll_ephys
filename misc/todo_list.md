# Todo list

1. Test the duration for HD classification.
    1. Restrict neural data to time that subjects literally have snout in poke [X]
    1. Leave out more neighbours (in graph or in space).
1. Look at and make spike raster population for the generalisation rotation thing [X]
1. Look at representations in pokes in light of the order in which they were added during learning
1. Look at cells that dominate the correlations during the across task generalisation thing
1. Assuming that we believe the alignment by direct rotation, run SVD or CCA on this dataset

1. Take out current location space. then look for now location space. That tells you about information from previous. 
Subtract space. Rotate graph by 1 correlate with space again. To see if 

1. rerun try_rotate_non_spatial_responses

1. rerun transition analysis switching graphs, use this as the null distribution instead of shuffles

1. Transition anaylsis without space.
